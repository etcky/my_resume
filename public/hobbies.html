<p>
    I like to sit at home and do something on computer , 
    and it doesn`t matter what it is certenetly , playing 
    games , whatching videos on YouTube or whatching series.You 
    already know my favourite films , i`ve added only films,
    because i think that i don`t have favourite seria, but 
    if we are talking about anime , i like Demon Slayer , Solo Leveling ,
    Noragami and many more. As for the games , i like to play 
    cs2 , PUBG , Valorant, so you can assume i like FPS shooters . 
    Programming takes an importaint part of my life , but i can`t say 
    that it is my hobby , sometimes i need to take a rest from it .
    Music is the big part of my life , because it always plays 
    on the back , i`ve started my music journey from rock
    and it often plays in my headphones until now . I like to 
    go outside sometimes too , but if the weather is good , it doesn`t matter 
    is it cold or warm , i need it just to be calm.
